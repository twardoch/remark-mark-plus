1.  **Project Setup & Initial Cleanup:**
    *   Create `PLAN.md` with this detailed plan.
    *   Create `TODO.md` with a checklist summary.
    *   Create an empty `CHANGELOG.md`.

2.  **`package.json` Refinements:**
    *   Remove the duplicate "Victor Felder" entry from `contributors`.
    *   Verify all dependencies in `devDependencies` are necessary and up-to-date. For MVP, we'll assume they are mostly fine unless a glaring issue is found. (Deferring major dependency updates unless strictly needed for a bug).

3.  **`README.md` Corrections:**
    *   Fix the broken license link (`master//LICENSE` to `master/LICENSE`).
    *   Review for any other typos or outdated information. Ensure clarity, especially around the direct use of `micromark-syntax`.

4.  **`src/lib/micromark-syntax.js` Review and Simplification:**
    *   Remove commented-out unused variables (`self`, `openSeqSize`, `textStartPoint`).
    *   Critically evaluate the tokenizer logic, especially `checkAfterOpening` and `closingSequence`:
        *   The comment `// Disallow "===", "==\\s", or "==" at EOF.` in `checkAfterOpening` is crucial. Ensure the logic correctly implements this.
        *   The comment `// Valid opening, proceed to content` should be verified.
        *   Address the concern: `// This simplified version doesn't robustly check "no space before closing marker".` For MVP, decide if the current behavior is acceptable or if a simple check can be added without much complexity.
        *   Address the concern: `// It also doesn't correctly handle "==a =b==" (single '=' consumed by closingSequence and fail).` and `// This means "==a=b==" would fail to parse the outer mark correctly.` Determine if this is a critical bug for MVP. If fixing is complex, document it as a known limitation. If simple, attempt a fix.
    *   Clarify or remove comments that refer to "omitted for simplicity" if the current simple state is the intended MVP state.

5.  **`src/lib/mdast-util-handlers.js` Review:**
    *   Review `markFromMarkdown` exit handlers: if `markText` and `markSequence` exits are truly no-ops, consider removing them for conciseness or ensure comments clearly state why they are present (even if empty).
    *   Review `joinMark`: The current `return true` is simple. Trim the extensive comments comparing it to `gfm-strikethrough` if this simplicity is maintained for MVP, or update comments if logic changes.

6.  **Code Comments and Documentation:**
    *   Ensure all public APIs (exports from `index.js`, `micromark-syntax.js`) are clearly commented (JSDoc).
    *   Remove any misleading or outdated comments throughout the codebase.

7.  **Testing:**
    *   Run existing tests (`npm test`) to ensure no regressions are introduced by changes.
    *   If tokenizer logic in `micromark-syntax.js` is changed (e.g., to handle `==a=b==` or spacing rules), add new test cases to `__tests__/index.js` to cover these scenarios.

8.  **Build and Final Review:**
    *   Run the build (`npm run build`) to ensure it completes successfully.
    *   Review all changes for clarity, correctness, and adherence to MVP goals.
    *   Update `CHANGELOG.md` with all significant changes.
    *   Update `PLAN.md` and `TODO.md` to reflect completed steps.

9.  **Submission:**
    *   Commit changes with a descriptive message.
