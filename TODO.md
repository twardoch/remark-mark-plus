- [X] **Project Setup & Initial Cleanup:**
    - [X] Create `PLAN.md` with this detailed plan.
    - [X] Create `TODO.md` with a checklist summary.
    - [X] Create an empty `CHANGELOG.md`.

- [X] **`package.json` Refinements:**
    - [X] Remove the duplicate "Victor Felder" entry from `contributors`.
    - [X] Verify `devDependencies` (deferring updates for MVP).

- [X] **`README.md` Corrections:**
    - [X] Fix broken license link.
    - [X] Review for typos/outdated info.

- [X] **`src/lib/micromark-syntax.js` Review and Simplification:**
    - [X] Remove commented-out unused variables.
    - [X] Evaluate tokenizer logic (`checkAfterOpening`, `closingSequence`).
        - [X] Verify `Disallow "===", "==\\s", or "==" at EOF.` (logic seems correct)
        - [X] Address robust check for space before closing marker (decided to keep current simpler behavior for MVP).
        - [ ] Address handling of cases like `==a=b==` (comments updated; to be verified in testing phase).
    - [X] Clarify/remove "omitted for simplicity" comments.

- [X] **`src/lib/mdast-util-handlers.js` Review:**
    - [X] Review `markFromMarkdown` exit handlers (no changes needed).
    - [X] Review `joinMark` and its comments (comments trimmed and clarified).

- [X] **Code Comments and Documentation:**
    - [X] Ensure JSDoc for public APIs (verified, looks good).
    - [X] Remove misleading/outdated comments (addressed in previous steps and re-verified).

- [X] **Testing:**
    - [X] Run existing tests (they are failing, core issue: mdast `mark` nodes appear to have no children).
    - [X] Add new test for `==a=b==` case (it fails, revealing a tokenizer bug where `==a=b==` is not parsed as a mark).
    - [X] Decide on fixing tokenizer bug for `==a=b==` (DEFERRED for MVP, documented as known issue in CHANGELOG).
    - [X] Prioritize fixing the "empty children" bug for mdast `mark` nodes (ATTEMPTED, bug remains, documented in CHANGELOG).

- [X] **Build and Final Review:**
    - [X] Run build (implicitly run by `npm install` and `npm test` pre-hooks, no separate build issues noted beyond test failures).
    - [X] Review all changes (done throughout the process).
    - [X] Update `CHANGELOG.md` (DONE).
    - [X] Update `PLAN.md` and `TODO.md` (DONE for TODO, PLAN reflects current state).
