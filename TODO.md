- [X] Investigate "Empty Marks Bug" in tokenizer and mdast handler.
- [X] Fix "Empty Marks Bug" (ensured text content is captured in mdast `mark` nodes).
- [X] Update `CHANGELOG.md` for "Empty Marks Bug" fix.
- [X] Investigate "Tokenizer Bug for Complex Inputs (`==a=b==`)" (original issue: `==a=b==` treated as literal).
- [PARTIAL] Attempt to fix "Tokenizer Bug for Complex Inputs (`==a=b==`)" by refactoring tokenizer to use `effects.attempt`.
    - This resolved the issue of `a=b` not being recognized as content within marks.
    - However, this introduced a new critical bug: "Appended Closing Delimiters" (`==text==` produces content `text==`).
- [X] Update `CHANGELOG.md` to reflect tokenizer refactoring and the new "Appended Closing Delimiters" bug.
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Investigate and fix "Appended Closing Delimiters" bug in `micromark-syntax.js`.
- [ ] Verify fix for "Tokenizer Bug for Complex Inputs (`==a=b==`)" is fully effective once the appended delimiters bug is resolved.
- [ ] Perform final testing of all features and edge cases.
- [ ] Ensure build process (`npm run build`) is successful.
- [ ] Address ESLint v9 compatibility issues (currently bypassed for testing).
- [ ] Submit changes.
